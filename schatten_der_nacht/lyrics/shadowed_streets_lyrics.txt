Verse]
Through the haze of the cigarette smoke,
A saxophone whispers where shadows evoke,
The piano tiptoes, soft and sly,
While muted trumpets give a midnight sigh.

[Verse 2]
The bassline strolls like a man on the prowl,
Each note a mystery, each beat a growl.
A snare drum brushes like footsteps near,
As secrets linger, thick with fear.

[Chorus]
Dim-lit alleys and dangerâ€™s kiss,
A melody cloaked in dark abyss.
Tension builds with every phrase,
Through smoky streets and shadowed haze.

[Bridge]
The guitar hums, with a low, sly grin,
Like a femme fatale drawing you in.
A crescendo peaks, then falls away,
Teasing the night, begging it to stay.

[Verse 3]
The rhythm fades to a knowing glance,
A crooked smile, a fleeting chance.
The instruments hush, as the story grows,
Through jazzy whispers, the mystery flows.

[Outro]
Fade to black, the scene takes flight,
A jazzy noir to haunt the night.
The music lingers, a memory untamed,
As credits roll, the shadows remain.
